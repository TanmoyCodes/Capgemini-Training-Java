SpaceStation Oxygen System
Scenario Description
You are tasked with designing the OxygenSystem module for a futuristic SpaceStation. The system manages multiple oxygen tanks, tracks total oxygen supply, and ensures astronauts get a safe and controlled supply.

Context
Each oxygen tank has:

tankID (unique ID of the tank)
currentOxygenLevel (liters of oxygen currently in the tank)
maxCapacity (maximum oxygen the tank can hold)
status (ACTIVE or INACTIVE – inactive tanks cannot supply oxygen)
The station also tracks:

totalOxygenInStation (total oxygen across all active tanks – static field)
totalTanks (total number of tanks created – static field)
Requirements
Private Fields & Encapsulation

All fields must be private.
External modules cannot directly modify oxygen levels, status, or total counts.
Tank Status

Only ACTIVE tanks contribute to the total oxygen.
Inactive tanks cannot add or dispense oxygen.
Controlled Access

Public methods must include:
addOxygen(int liters) → adds oxygen safely only if tank is active and does not exceed max capacity.
consumeOxygen(int liters) → consumes oxygen only if tank is active and does not drop below zero.
activateTank() and deactivateTank() → change tank status.
getCurrentOxygenLevel() → read-only access to this tank’s oxygen.
getMaxCapacity() → read-only access.
getTankStatus() → read-only access.
Static methods:
getTotalOxygenInStation() → returns total oxygen across active tanks.
getTotalTanks() → returns the total number of tanks created.
Initializers

Static initializer: set totalOxygenInStation and totalTanks to 0.
Non-static initializer: assign a unique tankID automatically when a tank is created.
Validation

Prevent overfilling beyond max capacity.
Prevent negative oxygen.
Prevent operations on inactive tanks.
Advanced Feature

Automatic update of totalOxygenInStation whenever an active tank’s oxygen changes.
Changing a tank to inactive removes its oxygen from total. Activating it adds its current oxygen back to total.
Tasks for Students
​
Create an OxygenSystem class.
Implement private fields, static and non-static variables, and initializer blocks.
Implement methods to safely add/consume oxygen, change tank status, and read oxygen levels.
Implement static methods to read total oxygen and total tanks.
Ensure all validations and automatic updates for total oxygen.
Example
Setup:

Tank 1: max 500 liters, ACTIVE, starts empty
Tank 2: max 300 liters, ACTIVE, starts empty
Tank 3: max 200 liters, INACTIVE, starts empty
Actions:

Add 400 liters to Tank 1.
Add 200 liters to Tank 2.
Attempt to add 100 liters to Tank 3 (inactive).
Consume 50 liters from Tank 1.
Deactivate Tank 2.
Activate Tank 3 and add 150 liters.
Check individual tank levels and statuses.
Check total oxygen in station and total number of tanks.
Expected Output
Tank 1 current oxygen: 400 liters
Tank 2 current oxygen: 200 liters
Cannot add oxygen: Tank 3 is inactive
Tank 1 consumed 50 liters. Current level: 350 liters
Tank 2 deactivated. Oxygen removed from station total.
Tank 3 activated.
Tank 3 current oxygen: 150 liters
Tank 1 status: ACTIVE, oxygen: 350 liters
Tank 2 status: INACTIVE, oxygen: 200 liters
Tank 3 status: ACTIVE, oxygen: 150 liters
Total oxygen in station: 500 liters
Total tanks created: 3

Learning Objectives
Deepen understanding of encapsulation and controlled access.
Practice static vs non-static fields and methods.
Implement initializer blocks for static and instance variables.
Handle conditional updates based on tank status.
Maintain data integrity across multiple objects with shared state.
Understand how private fields + public methods enforce safe system behavior in critical applications.
Note to Students:
All oxygen operations must validate status and capacity. Changing tank status must automatically update the station’s total oxygen. Direct manipulation of oxygen levels or totals outside the class is prohibited.
