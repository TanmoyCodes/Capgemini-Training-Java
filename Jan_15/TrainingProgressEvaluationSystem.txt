Training Progress Evaluation System
Your organization wants to build an internal tool to track the progress of employees undergoing different types of training programs. As a developer, you are asked to create a simple Java-based object-oriented model for this system.

a. Create an abstract class Trainee with the following:
Fields:
id
name
trainingType
Abstract Method:
double calculateProgressScore()
Concrete Method:
displayDetails() → prints trainee info
b. Create two subclasses:
1. TechnicalTrainee
Additional field:

modulesCompleted
Progress formula:

score = modulesCompleted × 10
2. SoftSkillTrainee
Additional field:

sessionsAttended
Progress formula:

score = sessionsAttended × 8
c. Create a class TrainingReport that:
Accepts a List<Trainee>
Prints progress scores for each trainee
Identifies and prints the top performer
Demonstrates polymorphism by storing both trainee types in a single List
Dataset to Use:
Use these trainees inside main:

ID	Name	Training Type	Extra Field Type	Extra Value
T01	Amit	Technical	modulesCompleted	12
T02	Neha	Soft Skill	sessionsAttended	15
T03	Rohit	Technical	modulesCompleted	9
T04	Sneha	Soft Skill	sessionsAttended	20
Expected Output:
Trainee Details:
T01 - Amit - Technical
Progress Score: 120.0


T02 - Neha - Soft Skill
Progress Score: 120.0

T03 - Rohit - Technical
Progress Score: 90.0

T04 - Sneha - Soft Skill
Progress Score: 160.0

Top Performer:
Sneha with a score of 160.0
